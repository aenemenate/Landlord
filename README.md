# Landlord-Master
This is my master copy of the source code for my game, Landlord.

Requires Visual Studio >= 2017.

To compile, simply create a project directory on your computer (Projects => Landlord-Master => Landlord-Master => repository files)

Then open Landlord.csproj and save a new solution in the first of the two Landlord-Master folders.

My goals with this codebase as of 2019 are to (1) Optimize and (2) Implement new features. 

Optimizations are welcome and appreciated. Features though are touchier. If you'd like
to aid in feature development please email me at aenemenate@gmail.com.
