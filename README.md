# Landlord-Master
This is my master copy of the source code for my game, Landlord.

Requires Visual Studio >= 2017.

To compile, simply create a project directory on your computer (Projects => Landlord-Master => Landlord-Master => repository files)

Then open Landlord.csproj and save a new solution in the first of the two Landlord-Master folders.

## Contributor Goals

My goals with this codebase as of 2019 are to (1) Implement new features and (2) Optimize.
Following this reasoning heirarchy, the goal of all contributors as of right now should be to implement missing content as issues are added and referenced in the projects.

If you are a specific kind of content developer and would like to find issues related to your specialization, check out the [Projects](https://github.com/aenemenate/Landlord-Master/projects). Here issues are seperated into [Gameplay](https://github.com/aenemenate/Landlord-Master/projects/6), [Story Content](https://github.com/aenemenate/Landlord-Master/projects/7), [Graphics/UI](https://github.com/aenemenate/Landlord-Master/projects/4), and [Sound](https://github.com/aenemenate/Landlord-Master/projects/3). I am currently sorting issues into these categories on a daily basis.

Note that refactoring of code is not currently being considered a priority and probably won't be until the game has reached 0.1-1. Once missing features are implemented though, I intend to switch focus towards refactoring and optimization for a time.

## Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress by myself. Start reading [here](https://github.com/aenemenate/Landlord-Master/wiki).
