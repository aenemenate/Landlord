# Landlord-Master
This is my master copy of the source code for my game, Landlord.

Requires Visual Studio >= 2017.

To compile, simply create a project directory on your computer (Projects => Landlord-Master => Landlord-Master => repository files)

Then open Landlord.csproj and save a new solution in the first of the two Landlord-Master folders.

My goals with this codebase as of 2019 are to (1) Optimize and (2) Implement new features. 

I have no intention of selling Landlord at any point. I am open sourcing this codebase because this is a learning project and I believe in open-source principles as a sound software development method.

I believe that the creativity and skills of particular contributors will vastly exceed mine along many dimensions and I am welcoming and excited to see our overlap blossom forth into a fun game, thank you!
