# Landlord v0.05-5

Landlord is a roguelike game about purchasing plots of land and using them to make money. Currently the features are sparse, but I'm working slowly on adding everything that's necessary to the final vision.

At the moment my focus is on vastly restructuring the code in a way that is extendable, and hopefully faster as well. I will start with small things, i.e. GUI, map structure, scheduling, etc. Eventually I plan to implement an entity component system for entities and items. From there development shouldn't go much farther, I simply don't want to see this engine waste away in its current state!
