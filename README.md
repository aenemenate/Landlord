# Landlord-Master
This is my master copy of the source code for my game, Landlord.

Requires Visual Studio >= 2017.

To compile, simply create a project directory on your computer (Projects => Landlord-Master => Landlord-Master => repository files)

Then open Landlord.csproj and save a new solution in the first of the two Landlord-Master folders.

My goals with this codebase as of 2019 are to (1) Implement new features and (2) Optimize.
Following this reasoning heirarchy, the goal of all contributors as of right now should be to implement missing content as it's added to the issue list. Refactoring of code shall not be a priority until the game has reached a 0.1 state. Once missing features are implemented though, I intend to switch this around and focus heavily on refactoring for a time.

Documentation is a work in progress by myself. Start reading [here](https://github.com/aenemenate/Landlord-Master/wiki).
