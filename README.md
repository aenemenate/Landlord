# Landlord-Master
This is my master copy of the source code for my game, Landlord.

Requires Visual Studio >= 2017.

To compile, simply create a project directory on your computer (Projects => Landlord-Master => Landlord-Master => repository files)

Then open Landlord.csproj and save a new solution in the first of the two Landlord-Master folders.

My goals with this codebase as of 2019 are to (1) Optimize and (2) Implement new features. 

I have no intention of selling Landlord based on the merits of the code or gameplay features alone. Landlord will never be sold in a capacity that does not include a graphical overhaul of some sort. I am open sourcing this codebase because I believe in open-source principles as a sound software development method. I believe that the creativity and skills of particular contributors will vastly exceed mine along many dimensions and I am welcoming and excited to see our overlap blossom forth into a fun game, thank you!
